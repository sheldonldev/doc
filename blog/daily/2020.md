The past two months, I earned a lot of benefits from learning Vim and Neovim. 
I now know what makes an IDE.

I compared Vim and Neovim, though Neovim is newer and more featured, but Vim is quicker and lighter. Neovim still have some bug which makes itself crash down sometime, so I'm still using Vim. 

It should contains syntax highliting. I built the colorscheme myself, and use ployglot to highlight syntax, of course, I can also costumize my syntax according to vim manual.

It should contains explorer. I'v tried NERDTree, coc-explorer, defx. But finally, I choose to use the built-in explorer. There is no need to use a complicated exploer for vim, its easy to manipulate your files or folders in terminal I think.

It should contains status line and buffer tabs. I built status line myself, and use a light plugin bufftabline to show the tabs on the top of my editor.

It should contains auto completion tools togethor with Language Servers is very useful. I choose coc.nvim and some of its extensions. But do not use too much extensions, and read the documentations before you use it.

Snippets can also help auto compeletion learn how to use snippets is very helpful.

Emmet is a another useful tool for auto compeletion for html.

Other handy plugins such as vim-commentary, vim-hexokinase are great.
