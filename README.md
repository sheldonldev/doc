# About

Previously, I majored in Animal Science and I've got my master's degree. I'm good at data analytics and report presentation. But I also feel passionate about information technology. I often help people solving problems by using IT tricks and writing scripts when I still a university student, and I once successfully shortlisted in the National College Student Mathematical Modeling Contest. 

After graduating from university, my curiosity drives me to learn more. I found my way to learn Computer Science through a lot of MOOCs such as Coursera, edX, Linux Foundation, FreeCodeCamp, etc... Everything I learn from those MOOCs refreshes my view of seeing the world and take my breath away, as a Chinese girl. 

Gradually, I leave my old job and start taking up some projects such as data visualization and web development, and I also participate in some open source communities. I'm keen to join in more projects and hope I can contribute more.
