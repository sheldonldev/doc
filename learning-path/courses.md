## Courses

### Basics

* [x] [Internet History, Technology, and Security](https://www.coursera.org/learn/internet-history/home/welcome)

  > This is the first course I took when I wondering where I should begin. [Dr. Chuck](https://online.dr-chuck.com/) is the one who opened my door to be a programmer.

* [x] [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

  > It gives me such a wide vision as a web developer.

  It contains another course the author of which is Dr. Chuck, the one who created the course Internet History \(the first one I recommended\):

  * [x] [Python for Everybody Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python)

* [x] [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science)

  > After taking this course, I began my career: I Independently finished a data annalistic and visualization task: [Meat Atlas of China](https://meatatlas.github.io/).

* [x] [Google IT Automation with Python](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-it-automation)
* [x] [Introduction to Linux \(LFS101x\)](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS101x+1T2020/course/)

  > I think Linux is the best operating system to learn CS when macOS is still not affordable for me. You can get it and nearly all its applications for free. The first machine for me to learn dev was a 5-year-old Windows. Nearly half years later, I installed Ubuntu on it to turn it into a dual-system machine. Then I fell in love with Linux. So I learn more about it through this course.

* [x] [CS50 - Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)

  > Thanks to Dr. David, who brings me a lot of passionate. This course introduced nearly every thing you should know to get you prepared for your development career and help you think algorithmically.

  > I just read these materials, haven't take any certification exam yet. I'm still planning to get a certification. While It gives me a vision of the TCP/IP model which composes the lower level under the IOS model's application layer, presentation layer, and session layer. And it gives me more details about IPv4, IPv6, DNS, network security, IT automation, and more...

* [ ] CS51 - Abstraction and Design in Computation

Fundamental concepts in the design of computer programs, emphasizing the crucial role of abstraction. The goal of the course is to give students insight into the difference between programming and programming well. To emphasize the differing approaches to expressing programming solutions, you will learn to program in a variety of paradigms -- including functional, imperative, and object-oriented. Important ideas from software engineering and models of computation will inform these different views of programming.

* [ ] [- CS 61](https://cs61.seas.harvard.edu/) - Systems Programming and Machine Organization

Fundamentals of computer systems programming, machine organization, and performance tuning. This course provides a solid background in systems programming and a deep understanding of low-level machine organization and design. Topics include C and assembly language programming, program optimization, memory hierarchy and caching, virtual memory and dynamic memory management, concurrency, threads, and synchronization.
